   - "Remember this: my favorite color is blue"
   - "What did I just tell you to remember?"
   - "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"
   - "Create a function to sort a list"

### 🎯 Key Features Active

✅ **Multi-Agent Reasoning** - AI breaks down complex problems
✅ **Long-term Memory** - Remembers all conversations
✅ **Code Execution** - Can run Python code in real-time
✅ **Tool Use** - Extensible tool system
✅ **Chain-of-Thought** - See how the AI thinks
✅ **GPU Acceleration** - Using your RTX 4050

### 📊 UI Features

- **Show Stats Button**: Click to see detailed agent statistics
- **Clear Memory Button**: Reset conversation history
- **Reasoning Chain**: Expand to see AI's thought process
- **Analysis**: View query analysis details
- **Tool Results**: See code execution outputs

### 🎨 Advanced Capabilities

#### 1. Code Generation & Execution
Ask the AI to write code, and it will:
- Generate the code
- Execute it automatically
- Show you the results
- Handle errors gracefully

#### 2. Memory System
The AI remembers:
- All previous conversations
- Context from earlier in the session
- Can recall specific information on demand

#### 3. Reasoning Transparency
Unlike ChatGPT/Gemini, you can see:
- How the AI analyzed your query
- What tools it decided to use
- The reasoning chain it followed

### 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use the "Show Stats" button** to monitor system performance
2. **Check the reasoning chain** to understand AI decisions
3. **Try code-related queries** to see execution in action
4. **Test the memory** by asking it to remember and recall information
5. **Watch for the memory indicator** (💾) in responses

### 🔧 System Information

- **Engine**: Mistral 7B (Quantized for efficiency)
- **Mode**: Advanced Simulation (until model is downloaded)
- **GPU**: Detected and ready
- **Memory**: Persistent across sessions
- **Tools**: 4 built-in tools available

### 📥 To Get Full AI Power

Download the AI model for complete capabilities:
```bash
ai_sys\Scripts\python ai_core\download_model.py
```

This downloads Mistral 7B (~4.37 GB). Without it, the system runs in advanced simulation mode with all features except actual LLM inference.

### 🎮 Controls

- **Enter**: Send message
- **Show Stats**: Toggle detailed statistics
- **Clear Memory**: Reset conversation history
- **Expand Reasoning**: Click on "🧠 Reasoning Chain" in messages
- **View Analysis**: Click on "📊 Analysis" in messages

### 🌟 What Makes This Special

Unlike ChatGPT and Gemini:
1. **100% Local & Private** - Your data never leaves your computer
2. **Transparent Reasoning** - See exactly how it thinks
3. **Real Code Execution** - Actually runs code, not just generates it
4. **True Memory** - Persistent across all sessions
5. **Fully Customizable** - You own and control everything
6. **GPU Accelerated** - Uses your RTX 4050 for speed
7. **Extensible** - Easy to add new tools and capabilities

### 📚 Next Steps

1. **Explore the interface** at http://localhost:3000
2. **Try different types of queries** to see all features
3. **Check the README.md** for detailed documentation
4. **Customize the system** to your needs
5. **Add custom tools** in `ai_core/advanced_agent.py`
